# PYNQ Bootcamp

This is a repository of materials around the PYNQ Bootcamp, aimed at teaching
students how to program and interface with the PYNQ Z1/Z2 boards with the PYNQ
python framework. This repository contains notebooks that have been used in
previous bootcamps. Each notebook focuses on one area of functionality of the
PYNQ board. This repository also contains useful documentation for interns
running future bootcamps.


## Documentation

Along with jupyter notebooks, this repository contains documentation to help
interns get started as fast as possible with their boards, so that they can get
stared with interacting and experimenting with the PYNQ board.


- See the [Quickstart Guide](documentation/01_setup.md) for a quick introduction to
  getting your board up and running with a proper development environment.
- See [Network Configuration](documentation/02_networking.md) for guides on setting up a
  network connetion and troubleshooting common network errors.
- See [Contribution Help](documentation/03_contributing.md) for help with submitting
