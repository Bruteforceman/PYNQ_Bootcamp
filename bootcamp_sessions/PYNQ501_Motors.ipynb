    "### Background\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest of all motors, DC motors turn when a DC voltage is applied across it. This kind of motor can be found in drones, power tools, and robots. A DC motor can change speend and direction depending on how much power is fed to it and in which direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "The DC motor uses a magnetic field generated by the by an electromagnet to turn the armature of a motor. The electromagnet is activated by applying voltage, so when the power is on, the magnetic field it generates will cause the armature (a coil of wire) to generate its own nagmetic field, these fields push eachother away and cause the armature to spin.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get the motor to spin the other way, we need to reverse the applied voltage, meaning the flow of current through the motor will be reversed. Unfortunately switching the direction of current from a controller is difficult. The processors use low current and voltages, plus they are usually disconnected from the motor to prevent inductive feedback distrupting their operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "If only there was some kind of device that can help us control the power we supply to our DC motors…\n",
    "\n",
    "##### How H-Bridges Work\n",
    "An H-Bridge is a circuit that allows voltages to be applied across a load in either direction. Electric current flows from the source to ground, and many components need to be oriented according to the direction of current to work as expected. An H-Bridge is a circuit built to change the direction of the voltage and thus the current flowing to a load.\n",
    "\n",
    "An H-Bridge is made up of four switches: two in series, and two in parallel, with the load placed in between the switches. In this configuration the circuit takes an “H” shape.\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](data/H-Bridge.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to change the direction of the voltage supplied, the H-Bridge controls the switches that deliver power to the load (M). \n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the diagram, if we close S1 and S4 while leaving the rest open, the voltage will be applied from left to right across the motor. \n",
    "\n",
    "If S2 and S3 are closed instead and the others open, the voltage will be applied from right to left."
